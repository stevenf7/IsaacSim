===============================================
Randomization in Simulation -- UR10 Palletizing
===============================================

Example of using |isaac-sim_short| and Replicator to capture synthetic data from simulated environments (UR10 palletizing).

Learning Objectives
-------------------

The goal of this tutorial is to provide an example on how to extend an existing |isaac-sim_short| simulation to trigger a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline to randomize the environment and collect synthetic data at specific simulation events using the :doc:`omni.replicator <extensions:ext_replicator>` extension. 

.. note:: The tutorial makes sure that the SDG pipeline does not change the outcome of the running simulation and cleans up its changes after each capture.

This tutorial teaches you to:

* Collect synthetic data at specific simulation events with Replicator:

    * Using annotators to collect the data and manually write it to disk
    * Using writers to implicitly write the data to disk

* Setup various Replicator randomization graphs to:

    * Randomize lights around the object of interest
    * Randomize materials and textures of objects of interest running at different rates

* Create and destroy Replicator randomization and capture graphs within the same simulation instance
* Switch between different rendering modes on the fly
* Create and destroy render products on the fly to improve runtime performance

Prerequisites
-------------------

* Familiarity with the :doc:`omni.replicator <extensions:ext_replicator>` extension and its :doc:`annotators <extensions:ext_replicator/annotators_details>` and :doc:`writers <extensions:ext_replicator/writer_examples>`.
* Familiarity with Replicator :doc:`randomizers <extensions:ext_replicator/randomizer_details>` and :doc:`OmniGraph <extensions:ext_omnigraph>` for a better understanding of the randomization pipeline.
* Executing code from the :ref:`Script Editor <script-editor>`.

Scenario
---------

For this tutorial, you build on top of the UR10 palletizing demo scene, which is programmatically loaded and started by the provided script. 

The demo scene depicts a simple palletizing scenario where the UR10 robot picks up bins from a conveyor belt and places them on a pallet. 

For bins that are flipped, the robot flips them right side up with a helper object before placing them on the pallet.

    :width: 32.5%

.. image:: /images/isaac_tutorial_replicator_palletizing_full.gif
    :width: 32.5%

In the above images, data collected from the actions in the left side image belong to the **bin flip scenario**. 

In the above images, data collected from the right side image belongs to the **bin on pallet scenario**. 

For each frame in this scenario, the camera pose is iterated through in a predefined sequence, while the custom lights' parameters are randomized. Data is generated for each manipulated bin in the palletizing demo scene.

The events for which synthetic data are collected are:

* When the bin is placed on the flipping helper object
* When the bin is placed on the pallet (or on another bin that is already on the pallet)

Below, in each captured frame the bin colors are randomized. At a lower randomization rate, the camera poses and pallet textures are also randomized. 

.. image:: /images/isaac_tutorial_replicator_palletizing_data.png

The :doc:`annotator <extensions:ext_replicator/annotators_details>` data collected by the scenario includes the **LdrColor** (rgb) and **instance segmentation**. 

The data is directly accessed from the annotators and saved to disk using custom helper functions. 

The data is written to disk using a built-in Replicator :doc:`writer <extensions:ext_replicator/writer_examples>` (``BasicWriter``).

        The attributes of this class include:

        * ``self._bin_counter`` and ``self._num_captures`` are used to track the current bin index and the requested number of frames to capture
        * ``self._stage`` is used to access objects of interest in the environment during the simulation
        * ``self._active_bin`` is tracking the current active bin
        * ``self._stage_event_sub`` is a subscriber to stage closing events, it is used to cleanup the demo if the stage is closed
        * ``self._in_running_state`` indicates whether the demo is currently running
        * ``self._bin_flip_scenario_done`` is a flag to mark if the `bin flip` scenario has been completed, to avoid triggering it again
        * ``self._timeline`` is used to pause and resume the simulation in response to Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) events
        * ``self._timeline_sub`` is a subscriber to timeline events, allowing the monitoring of the simulation state (tracking the active bin's surroundings)
        * ``self._overlap_extent`` represents an extent cache of the bin size, which is used to query for overlaps around the active bin
        * ``self._rep_camera`` points the temporary replicator camera to capture SDG data
        * ``self._output_dir`` is the output directory where the SDG data gets stored


        **Start Function**
        
        The ``start`` function initializes and starts the SDG demo. During initialization (using ``self._init()``), it checks whether the UR10 palletizing demo is loaded and running. Additionally, it sets up the ``self._stage`` and ``self._active_bin`` attributes. The demo is then started with the ``self._start()`` function. This function subscribes to timeline events through ``self._timeline_sub``, which uses the ``self._on_timeline_event`` callback function to monitor the simulation state.

        **Timeline Advance and Bin Overlaps**
        
        
        On every timeline advance update, the ``self._check_bin_overlaps`` function is called to monitor the surroundings of the active bin. If an overlap is detected, the ``self._on_overlap_hit`` callback function is invoked. This function determines if the overlap is relevant to one of two scenarios: 
         
         * bin flip
         * bin on pallet

        If relevant, the simulation is paused, the timeline event subscription is removed, and the Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) starts for the current active bin. Depending on the current simulation state, the SDG is initiated by the ``self._run_bin_flip_scenario`` or the ``self._run_pallet_scenario`` function.

        When the active bin is positioned on the flip helper object, it triggers the **bin flip scenario**. In this scenario, path tracing is chosen as the rendering mode. To collect the data, Replicator annotators are used directly to access the data and the ``write_image`` function from ``omni.replicator.core.functional`` writes the data to disk.

        The ``_create_bin_flip_graph`` function is used to create the Replicator randomization graphs for the **bin flip scenario**. This includes the creation of a camera and randomized lights. After setting up the graph, a delayed preview command is dispatched, ensuring the graph is fully created prior to launching the Synthetic Data Generation (SDG). 

        The ``rep.orchestrator.step_async`` function is called for the requested number of frames (``self._bin_flip_frames``) to advance the randomization graph by one frame and provide the annotators with the new data. The data is then retrieved using the ``get_data()`` function and saved to disk using ``write_image``. To optimize simulation performance, render products are discarded after each SDG pipeline and the constructed Replicator graphs are removed.
        
        After the SDG scenario is completed, the render mode is set back to realtime path tracing. The timeline then resumes the simulation and the timeline subscriber is reactivated to continue monitoring the simulation environment. To ensure that the **bin flip scenario** doesn't re-trigger, given that the bin remains in contact with the flip helper object, the ``self._bin_flip_scenario_done`` flag is set to ``True``.

        For the **bin flip scenario**, the Replicator randomization graph uses a predefined color palette list. This list provides options for the system to randomly select colors when varying the lights using ``rep.distribution.choice(color_palette)``. Meanwhile, the camera operates from a set of predefined locations. Instead of random selections, the camera sequentially transitions between these locations using ``rep.distribution.sequence(camera_positions)``. Both the randomization of lights and the systematic camera movement are programmed to execute with every frame capture, as indicated by ``rep.trigger.on_frame()``.

        When the active bin is placed on the pallet, or on top of another bin on the pallet, it triggers the **bin on pallet scenario**. Because the randomization graph is modifying the materials and textures of the bins and the pallet, these original materials are cached. This ensures that they can be reapplied after the simulation resumes.
        
        The ``_create_bin_and_pallet_graph`` function sets up the Replicator randomization graphs for this scenario. These graphs include the camera, which randomizes its position around the pallet, the varying materials for the bins placed on the pallet, and the alternating textures for the pallet itself. After the graph is created, a delayed preview command is dispatched to ensure that it is fully generated before the Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) begins.

        For data writing, the **bin on pallet scenario** uses a ``DiskBackend`` with the built-in Replicator ``BasicWriter``. For each frame defined by ``self._pallet_frames``, the ``rep.orchestrator.step_async`` function advances the randomization graph by a single frame. This action also triggers the writer to save the data to disk. To improve performance during the simulation, the created render products are discarded after each scenario and the generated graphs are removed.

        After the scenario completes, the cached materials are re-applied. The system then checks to see if it has processed the last bin. If not, the simulation is resumed, designating the next bin as active and reactivating the timeline subscriber to continue monitoring the simulation environment.

        For the **bin on pallet scenario**, the Replicator randomization graph randomizes the colors of the bin materials. A predefined list of textures is used, from which the graph randomly selects and applies th pallet textures, this is done by ``rep.randomizer.texture(texture_paths,..)``. The camera's position varies around the pallet using ``rep.distribution.uniform(..)`` and is oriented towards the pallet's location. The trigger is split into two parts: 
        
        * the bin materials are changed **every frame** as shown by ``rep.trigger.on_frame()`` 
        * while the pallet textures and the camera positions are executed every **four frames**, represented by ``rep.trigger.on_frame(interval=4)``
