Adding Props
==========================================

Learning Objectives
=======================
This tutorial shows how to add objects to the scene and configure them for simulation.

*10-15 Minute Tutorial*


Adding Rubik's Cube
===================

Start by adding a Rubik's Cube to the scene.

1. Create a new stage on Isaac Sim by clicking on the **File** tab and then clicking on **New Stage**.

2. In the Content Browser, go to ``Isaac Sim`` > ``Props`` > ``Rubiks_Cube`` > ``rubiks_cube.usd`` and drag and drop the ``rubiks_cube.usd`` file into the stage. This will add a Rubik's Cube to the scene as a payload.

3. Left click on the Rubik's Cube and in the properties panel, set the ``Position`` to ``(0, 0, 0.1)``.

4. On the stage, right click ``Create`` > ``Isaac`` > ``Environment`` > ``Flat Grid`` to create a flat ground.

5. Click ``PLAY`` to start the simulation, you will see the Rubik's Cube is not falling to the ground. This is because the Rubik's Cube is not a rigid body.

6. Click ``STOP`` to stop the simulation.

Configure Physics Properties
============================

Add Rigid Body Properties
---------------------------

#. Right click on the Rubik's Cube and select ``Add`` > ``Physics`` > ``Rigid Body``. This will add a rigid body attribute to the Rubik's Cube and it will be affected by physics.

#. Now, click ``PLAY`` to start the simulation, you will see the Rubik's Cube fall through the ground, this is because the Rubik's Cube does not have a collision shape. Click ``STOP`` to stop the simulation.

Add Collision Properties
------------------------

#. Right click on the Rubik's Cube and select ``Add`` > ``Physics`` > ``Collider Presets``. This will add a collision attribute to the Rubik's Cube and it will collide with other objects.

#. Now, click ``PLAY`` to start the simulation, you will see the Rubik's Cube fall on the ground. Click ``STOP`` to stop the simulation.

Add Mass
--------

In addition to collision, you can also add mass, inertia, and center of mass to the Rubik's Cube to configure its physical properties. 

#. Right click on the Rubik's Cube and select ``Add`` > ``Physics`` > ``Mass``. This will add a mass attribute to the Rubik's Cube.

#. In the properties panel, scroll down to the ``Mass`` section and set the ``Mass`` to ``0.1`` to make it weigh 100 grams. 

.. Note::
    
    In addition to mass, you can also set the ``Density``, ``Center of Mass``, ``Diagonal Inertia``, and ``Principal Axes`` of the object.

    Setting the mass to 0 will make the simulation to compute it at runtime based on its volume (assuming 1000 kg/m^3 if density is not specified).


Visualize Collision Shapes
--------------------------

Right click on the ``Eye`` on the top left of the viewport and select ``Show By Type`` > ``Physics`` > ``Coliders`` > ``All``. This will show the collision shapes everything in the scene.

The ground plane's collider is pink to denote it is a static object. The Rubik's Cube is a dynamic object, so it falls to the ground and its collider is green.

.. Note:: 

    You can adjust the collider type by left clicking on the ``RubikCube`` mesh at ``World/rubiks_cube/RubikCube`` and scroll down to the ``Physics/Collider`` section, and select a different approximate type in the ``Approximation`` tab.


Customize Collider
-------------------

Let's customize the collider for the Rubik's Cube, by making it a sphere and easier to roll 

1. Left click on the ``RubikCube`` mesh at ``World/rubiks_cube/RubikCube`` and scroll down to the ``Physics/Collider`` section, press the ``x`` on the right to delete the current collider.

2. Left click on the ``RubikCube`` mesh and select ``Create`` > ``Shape`` > ``Sphere``. This will add a sphere shape around the Rubik's Cube.

3. Scroll down to the ``Geometry`` section and set the ``Radius`` to ``0.07`` to make the sphere smaller to match the Rubik's Cube.

4. Add a Collider to the sphere by selecting ``Add`` > ``Physics`` > ``Collider Presets``.

5. Hide the Sphere by unckecking the eye icon to the right of the sphere on the stage.

6. Slant the groundplane by going to ``FlatGrid`` and Click on ``Toggle Offset Mode`` icon on the right of ``Transform`` in the Properties panel, then setting the ``Rotation`` to ``(10, 0, 0)`` to give it a 10 degree slope.

7. Click ``PLAY`` to start the simulation, you will see the Rubik's Cube rolls on the ground. Click ``STOP`` to stop the simulation.

Add Physics Materials
---------------------

You can also apply surface properties to the Rubik's Cube by adding a physics material. 

#. Left click on the Rubik's Cube and in the properties panel, set the ``Position`` to ``(0, 0, 1)`` to move it up.

#. Right click on the Rubik's Cube and select ``Create`` > ``Physics`` > ``Physics Material``. This will add a physics material attribute to the Rubik's Cube. Drag it to the ``World/rubiks_cube/Looks`` folder.

#. In the properties panel, scroll down to the ``Physics Material`` section and set the ``Restitution`` to ``1`` to make it bounce.

#. Select the ``Sphere`` collider we created earlier and in the properties panel, scroll down to the ``Physics/Physics material on selected Material`` section and select the ``Physics Material`` we just created at ``/World/rubiks_cube/Looks/PhysicsMaterial``.

#. Click ``PLAY`` to start the simulation, you will see the Rubik's Cube rolls on the ground and bounces. Click ``STOP`` to stop the simulation.

.. Note::

    You can also set the ``Static Friction`` and ``Dynamic Friction`` as well.

.. Note::

    The completed asset is available at ``Isaac Sim`` > ``Samples`` > ``Rigging`` > ``RubiksCube`` > ``rubiks_cube.usd`` in the Content Browser.

Tips
-----

- Object rigid body api should be applied to the default prim of the object.
- collision API should be applied to the mesh prim of the object, and it should be applied as a **physXSchema** 

What's Next?
--------------

Extending from the concepts above, you assemble more complex collision shapes using basic shapes. For example, in the image below, we approximated a bearing collider using cylinders and rectangles.
