   For reference, see the source code for the Simulation Interfaces package `here <https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces>`_.

Overview
=======================

The ROS 2 Simulation Control extension uses the ROS 2 Simulation Interfaces to control Isaac Sim functions. This extension is designed to be scalable, allowing multiple services and actions to run simultaneously with little performance overhead.

The extension provides comprehensive control over Isaac Sim through ROS 2 services and actions, including:

* **Simulation State Control**: Play, pause, stop, and step through simulations
* **Entity Management**: Spawn, delete, and manipulate simulation entities (prims)
* **World Management**: Load, unload, and query simulation worlds (USD files)
* **State Querying**: Get information about entities, simulation state, and available resources

This allows you to control Isaac Sim programmatically or through the ROS 2 command line interface using the `Simulation Interfaces <https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces>`_ package to enable workflows like automated testing. This page lists and provides example commands for all of the services and actions from Simulation Interfaces supported by Isaac Sim. 

Enabling the Extension
----------------------------------

Enable Automatically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Open Isaac Sim from the terminal with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

Using the ROS 2 Simulation Control Services
===============================================

This section describes how to use each of the available services in detail.

GetSimulatorFeatures Service
--------------------------------------

The GetSimulatorFeatures service lists the subset of services and actions supported by Isaac Sim from simulation_interfaces.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_simulator_features simulation_interfaces/srv/GetSimulatorFeatures

**Notes:**

* Returns a list of supported features (for example, SPAWNING, DELETING, ENTITY_STATE_GETTING)
* Reports USD file format support using the spawn_formats field
* Provides custom_info with details about the implementation
* See the `full list of simulator features <https://github.com/ros-simulation/simulation_interfaces/blob/main/msg/SimulatorFeatures.msg>`_ 


SetSimulationState Service
------------------------------------

The SetSimulationState service updates the global state of the simulation (stopped/playing/paused/quitting) corresponding to enums defined in SimulationState.msg (STATE_STOPPED, STATE_PLAYING, STATE_PAUSED, STATE_QUITTING).

1. To set simulation state to playing:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_simulation_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetSimulationState "{state: {state: 1}}"  # 1=playing

2. To set simulation state to paused:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_simulation_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetSimulationState "{state: {state: 2}}"  # 2=paused

3. To set simulation state to stopped:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_simulation_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetSimulationState "{state: {state: 0}}"  # 0=stopped

4. To quit the simulator:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_simulation_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetSimulationState "{state: {state: 3}}"  # 3=quit

**Notes:**

* State 0 (Stopped) is equivalent to pausing and resetting the simulation
* State 1 (Playing) starts the simulation timeline
* State 2 (Paused) pauses the simulation at the current time
* State 3 (Quitting) shuts down Isaac Sim

GetSimulationState Service
------------------------------------

The GetSimulationState service retrieves the current state of the entire simulation (stopped/playing/paused/quitting) corresponding to enums defined in SimulationState.msg (STATE_STOPPED, STATE_PLAYING, STATE_PAUSED, STATE_QUITTING).

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_simulation_state simulation_interfaces/srv/GetSimulationState

**Notes:**

* Returns state 0 for stopped, 1 for playing, 2 for paused
* Used to query the simulation state before performing operations like stepping

GetEntities Service
----------------------

The GetEntities service retrieves a list of all entities present in the simulation with optional filtering (using regex pattern).

1. Get all entities in the simulation:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntities "{filters: {filter: ''}}"

2. Get entities with full paths or partial paths. In this case filter for prims containing 'camera' in the path:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntities "{filters: {filter: 'camera'}}"

3. Get entities with paths starting with '/World':

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntities "{filters: {filter: '^/World'}}"

4. Get entities with paths ending with 'mesh':

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntities "{filters: {filter: 'mesh$'}}"

**Notes:**

* The filter parameter accepts POSIX Extended regular expressions for matching entity names (prim paths)
* Isaac Sim uses the full USD prim paths as entity names

GetEntityInfo Service
----------------------

The GetEntityInfo service provides detailed information about a specific entity, such as its type and properties.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_entity_info simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntityInfo "{entity: '/World/robot'}"

**Notes:**

* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` with EntityInfo if the entity exists
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if the entity doesn't exist
* The EntityInfo contains:
  * category: Currently always set to OBJECT (EntityCategory.OBJECT)
  * description: Empty string (reserved for future use)
  * tags: Empty array (reserved for future use)

GetEntityState Service
---------------------------

The GetEntityState service gets the pose, twist, acceleration of a specific entity relative to a given reference frame. Currently only world frames are supported. 

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_entity_state simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntityState "{entity: '/World/robot'}"

**Notes:**

* For entities with RigidBodyAPI, both pose and velocities will be returned
* For entities without RigidBodyAPI, only pose will be returned with zero velocities
* Acceleration values are always reported as zero (not provided by the current API)
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if successfully retrieved entity state
* Returns ``RESULT_NOT_FOUND`` if entity does not exist
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if error retrieving entity state

GetEntitiesStates Service
----------------------------------

The GetEntitiesStates service fetches the states (pose, twist, acceleration) in the world frame of multiple entities in the simulation.

1. Get states for all entities in the simulation:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities_states simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntitiesStates "{filters: {filter: ''}}"

2. Get states for entities containing 'robot' in their path:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities_states simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntitiesStates "{filters: {filter: 'robot'}}"

3. Get states for entities with paths starting with '/World':

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_entities_states simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntitiesStates "{filters: {filter: '^/World'}}"

**Notes:**

* Combines functionality from GetEntities and GetEntityState services
* Filters entities first using regex pattern matching
* Retrieves state for each filtered entity
* Returns list of entity paths and corresponding states
* For entities with RigidBodyAPI, both pose and velocities will be returned
* For entities without RigidBodyAPI, only pose will be returned with zero velocities
* Acceleration values are always reported as zero (not provided by the current API)
* Using this service is more efficient than making multiple GetEntityState calls when you need states for many entities
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if successfully retrieved entity states
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if error in filtering or retrieving states

DeleteEntity Service
-----------------------

The DeleteEntity service deletes a specified entity in the simulation.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /delete_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/DeleteEntity "{entity: '/World/robot'}"

**Notes:**

* The service will return ``RESULT_OK`` if the entity was successfully deleted
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if the entity is protected and cannot be deleted
* Uses prim_utils.is_prim_no_delete() to check if a prim can be deleted before attempting deletion

GetSpawnables Service
-----------------------

The GetSpawnables service discovers USD assets available for spawning. By default it searches
``/Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Robots`` in the Isaac assets root path. You can supply additional
custom search paths using the ``sources`` field.

1. List all default spawnables:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 service call /get_spawnables simulation_interfaces/srv/GetSpawnables

2. List spawnables from an additional local path:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 service call /get_spawnables simulation_interfaces/srv/GetSpawnables "{sources: ['/home/user/custom_robots']}"

3. List spawnables from multiple sources:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 service call /get_spawnables simulation_interfaces/srv/GetSpawnables "{sources: ['/home/user/robots', '/opt/isaac_assets/robots']}"

**Notes:**

* Default search path is ``/Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Robots`` (searched to a depth of 2)
* Additional paths in ``sources`` are searched recursively (unlimited depth)
* Each result is a ``Spawnable`` with ``uri`` (full asset URI), ``description`` (filename without extension), and empty ``spawn_bounds``
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if no asset root path is available and no ``sources`` are provided

.. note::

   **Windows users (including WSL):** When providing paths in ``sources``, use native Windows paths (for example, ``C:/Users/foo/robots``). WSL-style paths such as ``/mnt/c/Users/foo/robots`` are not accessible to the Isaac Sim Windows process and will return no results.

SpawnEntity Service
-----------------------

.. warning::

   **Deprecated.** Use the ``/spawn_entities`` service instead. ``SpawnEntities`` supports batch operations and per-entity error reporting, making it suitable for both single and multi-entity workflows.

.. dropdown:: SpawnEntity usage (deprecated)

   The SpawnEntity service spawns a new entity into the simulation at a specified location.

   1. Basic entity spawn with default position:

      .. code-block:: bash

         ros2 service call /spawn_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntity "{name: 'MyEntity', allow_renaming: false, uri: '/path/to/model.usd'}"

   2. Spawn with specific position and orientation:

      .. code-block:: bash

         ros2 service call /spawn_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntity "{name: 'PositionedEntity', allow_renaming: false, uri: '/path/to/model.usd', initial_pose: {pose: {position: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}}}"

   3. Empty Xform creation (no URI):

      .. code-block:: bash

         ros2 service call /spawn_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntity "{name: 'EmptyXform', allow_renaming: false, uri: ''}"

   4. With auto-renaming enabled:

      .. code-block:: bash

         ros2 service call /spawn_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntity "{name: 'AutoRenamedEntity', allow_renaming: true, uri: '/path/to/model.usd'}"

   5. With namespace specified:

      .. code-block:: bash

         ros2 service call /spawn_entity simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntity "{name: 'NamespacedEntity', allow_renaming: false, uri: '/path/to/model.usd', entity_namespace: 'robot1'}"

   **Notes:**

   * If URI is provided, loads the USD file as a reference in the given prim path
   * If URI is not provided, creates a Xform at the given prim path
   * All spawned prims are marked with a ``simulationInterfacesSpawned`` attribute for tracking
   * Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if the entity was successfully spawned
   * Returns ``NAME_NOT_UNIQUE (101)`` if the entity name already exists and ``allow_renaming`` is false
   * Returns ``NAME_INVALID (102)`` if the entity name is empty and ``allow_renaming`` is false
   * Returns ``RESOURCE_PARSE_ERROR (106)`` if failed to parse or load USD file

SpawnEntities Service
-----------------------

The SpawnEntities service spawns multiple entities in a single request. Each entry in
``spawn_requests`` follows the ``SpawnEntity.msg`` format and is processed independently.
Per-entity success or failure is reported in the ``results`` list.

.. note::

   This service requires ``simulation_interfaces`` >= 1.4.0 on ROS 2 Humble and >= 1.5.0 on ROS 2 Jazzy.

1. Spawn two entities at specific positions:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 service call /spawn_entities simulation_interfaces/srv/SpawnEntities "{
        spawn_requests: [
          {
            name: 'Robot1',
            allow_renaming: false,
            entity_resource: {uri: '/path/to/robot.usd'},
            initial_pose: {pose: {position: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}}
          },
          {
            name: 'Robot2',
            allow_renaming: true,
            entity_resource: {uri: '/path/to/robot.usd'},
            initial_pose: {pose: {position: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}}
          }
        ]
      }"

**Notes:**

* Each entry in ``spawn_requests`` uses the ``entity_resource.uri`` field (not the flat ``uri`` field used by ``SpawnEntity``)
* Per-entity results are returned in the ``results`` list; check each ``SpawnResult`` for individual success or failure
* The aggregate ``result`` field is set to ``ENTITIES_SPAWN_FAILED`` if any individual spawn fails
* All other SpawnEntity rules apply to each entry (auto-renaming, ``simulationInterfacesSpawned`` tagging, etc.)

GetEntityBounds Service
--------------------------

The GetEntityBounds service computes and returns the world-space axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of an entity.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_entity_bounds simulation_interfaces/srv/GetEntityBounds "{entity: '/World/Cube'}"

**Notes:**

* Returns a ``Bounds`` message with ``type=TYPE_BOX`` and two ``points``: the minimum corner and the maximum corner of the AABB
* Bounding box is computed at the default USD time code and includes only prims with the ``default`` purpose
* Returns ``RESULT_NOT_FOUND`` if the entity does not exist
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if the bounds computation fails

ResetSimulation Service
---------------------------

The ResetSimulation service resets the simulation environment to its initial state.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /reset_simulation simulation_interfaces/srv/ResetSimulation

**Notes:**

* Stops the simulation timeline
* Finds and removes all prims with simulationInterfacesSpawned attribute
* Uses multiple passes to ensure all spawned entities are removed
* Restarts the simulation timeline
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if successfully reset
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if error resetting simulation

SetEntityState Service
---------------------------
 
The SetEntityState service sets the state (pose, twist) of a specific entity in the simulation. Only transforms in the **world** frame are currently accepted.

1. Set only position and orientation:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_entity_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetEntityState "{
        entity: '/World/Cube', 
        state: {
          header: {frame_id: 'world'}, 
          pose: {
            position: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, 
            orientation: {w: 1.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}
          },
          twist: {
            linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0},
            angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}
          }
        }
      }"

2. Set position, orientation and velocity (for entities with rigid body physics):

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /set_entity_state simulation_interfaces/srv/SetEntityState "{
        entity: '/World/RigidBody', 
        state: {
          header: {frame_id: 'world'}, 
          pose: {
            position: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}, 
            orientation: {w: 1.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}
          },
          twist: {
            linear: {x: 0.5, y: 0.0, z: 0.0},
            angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.1}
          }
        }
      }"

**Notes:**

* The position and orientation are always updated for any entity
* Velocities are only set for entities with a RigidBodyAPI
* For non-rigid bodies, only position and orientation will be set (velocity settings are ignored)
* Acceleration settings are not currently supported and will be ignored
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if successfully set entity state
* Returns ``RESULT_NOT_FOUND`` if entity does not exist
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if error setting entity state

StepSimulation Service
------------------------

The StepSimulation service simulates a finite number of steps and returns to PAUSED state.

1. Step the simulation by 1 frame (note: will use 2 steps internally):

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /step_simulation simulation_interfaces/srv/StepSimulation "{steps: 1}"

2. Step the simulation by 10 frames:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /step_simulation simulation_interfaces/srv/StepSimulation "{steps: 10}"

3. Step the simulation by 100 frames:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /step_simulation simulation_interfaces/srv/StepSimulation "{steps: 100}"

**Notes:**

* The simulation must be in a paused state before stepping can be performed
* The service call will block until all steps are completed
* After stepping completes, the simulation will automatically return to a paused state
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if stepping completed successfully
* Returns ``RESULT_INCORRECT_STATE`` if the simulation is not paused when the service is called
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if any error occurs during stepping

LoadWorld Service
------------------------

The LoadWorld service loads a world or environment file into the simulation, clearing the current scene and setting the simulation to stopped state. Currently supports USD format worlds.

1. Load a world from a USD file:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /load_world simulation_interfaces/srv/LoadWorld "{uri: '/path/to/world.usd'}"

2. Load a sample world with Isaac Sim sample environments:

   .. .. code-block:: bash
   
   ..    ros2 service call /load_world simulation_interfaces/srv/LoadWorld "{uri: 'Isaac/Environments/Simple_Room/simple_room.usd'}"

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /load_world simulation_interfaces/srv/LoadWorld "{uri: 'https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/6.0/Isaac/Environments/Simple_Room/simple_room.usd'}"

3. Load a sample world with a ROS2 scenario:

   .. .. code-block:: bash
   
   ..    ros2 service call /load_world simulation_interfaces/srv/LoadWorld "{uri: 'Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Scenario/carter_warehouse_apriltags_worker.usd'}"

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /load_world simulation_interfaces/srv/LoadWorld "{uri: 'https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/6.0/Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Scenario/carter_warehouse_apriltags_worker.usd'}"

**Notes:**

* Only USD files (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) are supported
* The simulation must be stopped or paused before loading a world (not playing)
* Loading a world will clear the current scene and create a new stage from the USD file
* If the given path cannot be found directly, Isaac Sim will automatically try prefixing it with the default asset root path
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if the world was successfully loaded
* Returns ``UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT`` if the file format is not supported
* Returns ``RESOURCE_PARSE_ERROR`` if the USD file cannot be parsed or loaded
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if the simulation is playing when the service is called

UnloadWorld Service
------------------------

The UnloadWorld service unloads the current world from the simulation, clearing the current scene and creating a new empty stage. Any previously spawned entities will be removed.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /unload_world simulation_interfaces/srv/UnloadWorld

**Notes:**

* The simulation must be stopped or paused before unloading a world (not playing)
* Creates a new empty stage after unloading the current world
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` if the world was successfully unloaded
* Returns ``NO_WORLD_LOADED`` if no world is currently loaded
* Returns ``RESULT_OPERATION_FAILED`` if the simulation is playing when the service is called

GetCurrentWorld Service
------------------------

The GetCurrentWorld service returns information about the currently loaded world, including its URI, name, and format.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 service call /get_current_world simulation_interfaces/srv/GetCurrentWorld

**Notes:**

* Returns world information including URI and name if a world is loaded from a file
* For worlds created in memory (new stage), returns empty URI and "untitled_world" as the name
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` with world information if successful
* Returns ``NO_WORLD_LOADED`` if no world is currently loaded

GetAvailableWorlds Service
-----------------------------

The GetAvailableWorlds service returns a list of available world files that can be loaded into the simulation. It searches default Isaac Sim paths for USD world files, with support for TagsFilter-based filtering.

1. Get all default available worlds:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_available_worlds simulation_interfaces/srv/GetAvailableWorlds

2. Get worlds with tag filtering (search for default worlds with specific tags in filename):

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_available_worlds simulation_interfaces/srv/GetAvailableWorlds "{filter: {tags: ['warehouse', 'carter']}, continue_on_error: true}"

3. Search additional custom paths:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_available_worlds simulation_interfaces/srv/GetAvailableWorlds "{additional_sources: ['/custom/worlds/path'], continue_on_error: true}"

4. Offline-only search with additional local sources:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 service call /get_available_worlds simulation_interfaces/srv/GetAvailableWorlds "{additional_sources: ['/home/user/custom_worlds', '/opt/isaac_worlds'], offline_only: true, continue_on_error: true}"

**Notes:**

* Searches default Isaac Sim paths: ``/Isaac/Environments`` and ``/Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Scenario``
* Supports TagsFilter with FILTER_MODE_ANY (default) or FILTER_MODE_ALL for tag matching
* Can search additional custom paths specified in ``additional_sources``
* Set ``offline_only: true`` to only search local filesystem paths
* Set ``continue_on_error: true`` to continue searching even if some paths fail
* Returns ``RESULT_OK`` with list of available worlds
* Returns ``DEFAULT_SOURCES_FAILED`` if default asset paths are not accessible and no additional sources are provided

.. note::

   **Windows users (including WSL):** When providing paths in ``additional_sources``, use native Windows paths (for example, ``C:/Users/foo/worlds``). WSL-style paths such as ``/mnt/c/Users/foo/worlds`` are not accessible to the Isaac Sim Windows process and will return no results.

Using the ROS 2 Simulation Control Actions
============================================

SimulateSteps Action
----------------------

The SimulateSteps action simulates a finite number of steps and returns to PAUSED state with feedback after each step.

1. Basic usage - Step the simulation by 10 frames:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 action send_goal /simulate_steps simulation_interfaces/action/SimulateSteps "{steps: 10}"

2. With feedback - Step the simulation by 20 frames and show feedback:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ros2 action send_goal /simulate_steps simulation_interfaces/action/SimulateSteps "{steps: 20}" --feedback

**Notes:**

* The simulation must be in a paused state before stepping can be performed
* After steps are completed, the simulation will return to a paused state
* You will receive feedback after each step showing completed and remaining steps
* The action can be canceled while executing

Technical Details
=====================

The extension uses the ``omni.timeline`` interface to control the simulation state and provides a clean ROS 2 interface through standard services. The implementation includes:

* A singleton ``ROS2ServiceManager`` to handle all ROS 2 services through a single node
* A ``SimulationControl`` class that interfaces with Isaac Sim's timeline
* Thread-safe implementation for ROS 2 spinning independent of Action Graph interface

Extending
----------

To add more simulation control services, extend the ``SimulationControl`` class and register additional services with the ``ROS2ServiceManager``.
