======================================
Automatic ROS 2 Namespace Generation
======================================

Learning Objectives
=======================

In this tutorial we will:

- Learn how to configure your |isaac-sim_short| assets to automatically generate ROS 2 namespaces for each ROS 2 OmniGraph node

Getting Started
=============================



**Prerequisite**

- Completed :ref:`isaac_sim_app_install_ros` so that the necessary environment variables are set and sourced before launching |isaac-sim|, and ROS 2 extension is enabled.

- Read about `ROS 2 Namespaces <https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic_and_service_names.html>`_.


ROS 2 Namespaces
==========================================================

Managing namespaces in ROS 2 is crucial for multi-robot simulations to ensure that each robot's topics are uniquely identifiable. 

There are currently two main ways within OmniGraph to set a namespace for ROS publisher, subscribers and services.

#. Manually set namespaces in the namespace field in the `nodeNamespace` field.

#. (Recommended) Configure assets to automatically generate namespaces for all Isaac Sim ROS OmniGraph nodes. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up namespaces in Isaac Sim, enabling efficient topic management and avoiding conflicts.

Configuring the Asset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting Up the Base Asset
****************************

#. Open a new stage. Open the Script Editor (``Window > Script Editor``), then add and run the following snippet. This will create a set of XForms that arranged to mimic a robot articulation.

        .. code-block:: bash

            # Import necessary modules
            from pxr import UsdGeom
            import omni.usd

            # Retrieve the current stage
            stage = omni.usd.get_context().get_stage()

            # Ensure a stage is loaded
            if not stage:
                print("No stage is currently loaded. Please load a stage and try again.")
            else:
                # Create the mock_robot Xform as the root
                mock_robot = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot")

                # Create the base_link Xform under mock_robot
                base_link = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot/base_link")

                # Create lidar_link and position it 0.4 meters above the base_link (Z-axis)
                lidar_link = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot/base_link/lidar_link")
                lidar_link.AddTranslateOp().Set(value=(0, 0, 0.4))  # Offset along Z-axis

                # Create camera_link and position it 0.2 meters above the base_link (Z-axis)
                camera_link = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link")
                camera_link.AddTranslateOp().Set(value=(0, 0, 0.2))  # Offset along Z-axis

                # Create wheel_left and wheel_right Xforms under base_link
                wheel_left = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot/base_link/wheel_left")
                wheel_right = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/mock_robot/base_link/wheel_right")

                # Position wheel_left 0.2 meters to the left of the center (X-axis)
                wheel_left.AddTranslateOp().Set(value=(-0.2, 0, 0))

                # Position wheel_right 0.2 meters to the right of the center (X-axis)
                wheel_right.AddTranslateOp().Set(value=(0.2, 0, 0))


#. Add a 2D RTX Lidar sensor by going to **Create > Sensors > RTX Lidar > NVIDIA > Example Rotary 2D** and drag it under ``/mock_robot/base_link/lidar_link``.


#. Add a Hawk stereo camera system by going to **Create > Sensors > Camera and Depth Sensors > LeopardImaging > Hawk** and drag it under ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link``.

#. Create a Generic Publisher by going to **Tools > Robotics > ROS 2 OmniGraphs > Generic Publisher**. Set **Generic Publisher Graph** as ``Publish String`` and the **Graph Path** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/wheel_left/String_graph``. Then hit **OK**. 

#. Create a TF Publisher by going to **Tools > Robotics > ROS 2 OmniGraphs > TF Publisher**. Set the **Target Prim** to ``/mock_robot`` and the **Graph Path** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/wheel_left/TF_graph``. Then hit **OK**. 

#. Create a Camera Publisher by going to **Tools > Robotics > ROS 2 OmniGraphs > Camera**. Set the **Camera Prim** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/left/camera_left`` and the **Graph Path** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/Camera_Left_Graph``. Uncheck the **Depth** topic and then hit **OK**. 

#. Create a second Camera Publisher by going to **Tools > Robotics > ROS 2 OmniGraphs > Camera**. Set the **Camera Prim** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/right/camera_right`` and the **Graph Path** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/Camera_Right_Graph``. Uncheck the **Depth** topic and then hit **OK**. 

#. Create a 2D RTX Lidar Publisher by going to **Tools > Robotics > ROS 2 OmniGraphs > RTX Lidar**. Set the **Lidar Prim** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/lidar_link/Example_Rotary_2D`` and the **Graph Path** to ``/mock_robot/base_link/lidar_link/Lidar_Graph``. Ensure only **Laser Scan** is enabled and then hit **OK**. 

Configuring Namespace Attributes
***********************************

Now that the base asset is setup, a ``isaac:namespace`` attribute must be added for each prim that a namespace value is desired. The namespace will be generated by appending each ``isaac:namespace`` attribute value that has been set from the top of the prim hierarchy down to each ROS publisher. The namespace generation behavior depends on the type of ROS publisher and where in the stage it is located.

**ROS 2 TF OmniGraph Nodes**: The namespace generated will only include the namespace value from the top level prim with a namespace attribute set. This is because all TFs published from within one robot are located under only that particular robot's namespace (that is, ``robot1/tf``).

**ROS 2 Camera & Lidar OmniGraph Helper Nodes**: The Camera or Lidar render product path is used to identify the path the namespace search algorithm takes and appends namespace values accordingly. Therefore in this case the location of the Camera/Lidar Helper node is not relevant and rather the location of the Camera/Lidar sensor prim is used.

**All other OmniGraph nodes**: The path to the OmniGraph node is used to identify the path the namespace search algorithm takes and appends namespace values accordingly. In this case the location of these OmniGraph node is relevant. 

Adding the ``isaac:namespace`` Prim Attribute
**************************************************

To add a ``isaac:namespace`` attribute to a prim follow these steps:

    #. Select the prim and in the property window, click **Add**. In the popup menu, go to **Isaac > Namespace**. This will apply this attribute to the prim. 

    #. In the property panel, add your namespace value in the **Namespace** field.

Testing the ``isaac:namespace`` Prim Attribute
**************************************************

Apply a ``isaac:namespace`` attribute to the following prims. For this tutorial set each namespace value to the prim name (although you are welcome to try any custom namespace value):

    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/lidar_link``
    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link``
    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk``
    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/left``
    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/camera_link/Hawk/right``
    - ``/mock_robot/base_link/wheel_left``

#. Click Play and start the simulation.

#. Open a ROS-sourced terminal and type ``ros2 topic list``, verify that you observe, at least, the following topics:

    - ``/camera_link/Hawk/left/camera_info``
    - ``/camera_link/Hawk/left/rgb``
    - ``/camera_link/Hawk/right/camera_info``
    - ``/camera_link/Hawk/right/rgb``
    - ``/lidar_link/laser_scan``
    - ``/wheel_left/tf``
    - ``/wheel_left/topic``


    From the above list you can observe the topics that have been generated automatically. If your namespace needs to have a custom naming scheme, you can fill in the ``nodeNamespace`` input field for each ROS OmniGraph node.

#. Stop the simulation. Select the ``/mock_robot`` prim and add the ``isaac:namespace`` attribute to it. Then, set the **namespace** value to the prim name.

#. Duplicate ``/mock_robot`` prim by selecting, right-clicking, and pressing **Duplicate**. For the newly generated ``/mock_robot_01``, select the prim, go to the property panel, and change the ``isaac:namespace`` attribute to ``mock_robot_01``. 

#. Hit Play to start the simulation.

#. Open a ROS-sourced terminal and type ``ros2 topic list``. Verify that you observe, at least, the following topics:

    **Topics from mock_robot**

        - ``/mock_robot/camera_link/Hawk/left/camera_info``
        - ``/mock_robot/camera_link/Hawk/left/rgb``
        - ``/mock_robot/camera_link/Hawk/right/camera_info``
        - ``/mock_robot/camera_link/Hawk/right/rgb``
        - ``/mock_robot/lidar_link/laser_scan``
        - ``/mock_robot/tf``
        - ``/mock_robot/wheel_left/topic``

    
    **Topics from mock_robot_01**

        - ``/mock_robot_01/camera_link/Hawk/left/camera_info``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/camera_link/Hawk/left/rgb``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/camera_link/Hawk/right/camera_info``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/camera_link/Hawk/right/rgb``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/lidar_link/laser_scan``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/tf``
        - ``/mock_robot_01/wheel_left/topic``

    .. important:: From the above list you can observe the topics have been generated automatically. If your namespace needs to have a custom naming scheme, you can fill in the ``nodeNamespace`` input field for each ROS OmniGraph node.
