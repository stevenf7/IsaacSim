# Validation Difference GIFs

Generate per-camera GIF animations showing the pixel-wise difference between captured benchmark images and their golden references. Useful for debugging validation tolerance failures.

## Prerequisites

- ImageMagick (`composite`, `convert`) must be available on `PATH`.
- A completed validation capture run with matching directory structure to the golden data.

## Paths

Captures and golden data live under the Isaac Sim build release directory:

```
standalone_examples/benchmarks/validation/captures/<run_name>/
standalone_examples/benchmarks/validation/golden_data/<benchmark_name>/
```

Both share a parallel directory tree (e.g. `Robots/Robot_0/.../front_hawk/left/camera_left/rgb/`).

## Usage

### Find the latest capture

```bash
ls -td standalone_examples/benchmarks/validation/captures/benchmark_robots_nova_carter_ros2_*/ | head -1
```

### Run the script

```bash
bash skills/validation-diff-gifs/scripts/generate_diff_gifs.sh \
    <captured_run_dir> \
    <golden_benchmark_dir> \
    [amplify] [fps]
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `captured_run_dir` | (required) | Root of the capture run |
| `golden_benchmark_dir` | (required) | Root of the golden data for the benchmark |
| `amplify` | `10` | Multiply pixel differences by this factor for visibility |
| `fps` | `5` | Frame rate for the output GIF |

### Example

```bash
LATEST=$(ls -td standalone_examples/benchmarks/validation/captures/benchmark_robots_nova_carter_ros2_*/ | head -1)
GOLDEN="standalone_examples/benchmarks/validation/golden_data/benchmark_robots_nova_carter_ros2"

bash skills/validation-diff-gifs/scripts/generate_diff_gifs.sh "$LATEST" "$GOLDEN"
```

## Output

For each `rgb/` directory under the capture, a `diff_animation.gif` is written alongside the captured PNGs:

```
<captured_run_dir>/Robots/.../front_hawk/left/camera_left/rgb/diff_animation.gif
```

- **Black pixels** = identical between captured and golden
- **Brighter pixels** = larger difference (amplified by the `amplify` factor)

## Interpreting results

- Uniform low-level noise across the frame → rendering non-determinism (likely acceptable)
- Bright regions concentrated on object edges → sub-pixel movement differences
- Entire frame bright → wrong timestamp match or completely different camera pose
- One camera consistently worse than others → possible per-camera issue (tick rate, initialization)
