    Load the contents of the USD test file onto the stage, synchronously, when called as "await load_test_file(X)".

    that tests can run concurrently, especially when loading files. This method encapsulates
    the logic necessary to load a test file using the open_stage_async method and then wait
    for it to complete before returning.
