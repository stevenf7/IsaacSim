# Changelog

## [0.4.7] - 2026-06-09
### Changed
- Teleop build validates NuRec render prerequisites (`setup_for_rendering`) on the loaded stage and aborts with a warning notification if one is unmet (e.g. `omni.rtx.spg` not enabled), instead of recording a black scene.
- For SPG scenes the chase viewport renders through the export's authored PPISP graph via `route_chase_through_ppisp`; non-SPG scenes point the viewport at the chase camera as before.
- Added a dependency on `isaacsim.replicator.nurec_utils`.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-06-07
### Changed
- `_cache_stage` now copies the input scene (and the files it needs) into a temporary folder before loading, then opens the stage from that copy. This removes the flatten + strip-kit-prims path and the USDZ re-export; USDZ inputs are copied as-is so every package member (including SPG `.cu.lua` launchers) is preserved, and recording start is much faster for large NuRec scenes.
- The recording panel now drives recordings through the shared `RecordingSession`, so the UI and headless scripts build and record scenes through the same path.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-04
### Removed
- Stale `multiGpu` disable from `[[test]]` args; the Kit 110.1.1 multi-GPU startup crash no longer reproduces.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-13
### Changed
- Clarified the `_cache_stage` docstring around what `export_as_stage` actually inlines.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-23
### Removed
- Remove the `omni.isaac.ml_archive` test dependency

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- Call `save_sensor_overrides` on recording start to persist camera calibration changes made in the UI
- Use `export_as_stage` when caching the scene stage to prevent black images on replay

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-18
### Changed
- Added return type annotations

- Replace `set_active_viewport_camera` with `ViewportManager.set_camera`
- Replace `objects.GroundPlane` (core.api) with `GroundPlane` from `isaacsim.core.experimental.objects`
- Use `save_stage` without deprecated `save_and_reload_in_place` argument
